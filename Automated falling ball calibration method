Falling ball viscosimeter calibration method

The main idea to calibrate this viscosimeter is use a solutions with a reference viscosity and measure the falling time of a 5mm steel ball 
for each solutions. This solutions should have a Newtonian behavior in rehological terms. Here we use a glycerol/water solutions that it has 
reference viscosity reported. The articule that you can use is "Segur, J. B., & Oberstar, H. E. (1951). Viscosity of glycerol and its aqueous 
solutions. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry, 43(9), 2117-2120.". This is the link to download:

The solutions that I used were 0,10,20,30,40,50,60,65,70,75 and 80% in volume/volume of Glycerol/water. 
Cautions: - You must do these solutions very well since the error of the viscometer depends on this.
          - The temperature of this solutions are very important to know the reference viscosity. Is for this reason that
             you must measure the temperature for each point that you measure.

Method:

First Step: 
The materials that you need are pure glycerol, 10-15ml centrifuge tubes, destilled water and 10ml graduated pipette. The glycerol is
very difficult to work because it has high viscosity. 
- Use the centrifuge tubes to make the different glycerol/water solutions. remember that the glycerol/water solutions are in volume/volume 
percentage. You must do the 10,20,30,40,50,60,65,70,75 and 80 %V/V glycerol/water solutions with a 10ml of final volume for each solutions.
For example for 10 %V/V glycerol/water you must add 1ml of glycerol and fill with water until 10ml. Here are a help table to make this 
solutions.

          Glycerol volume [ml]         -          Final Volume (fill with water) [ml]        -          % V/V glycerol/water 
                  1                    -                           10                        -                  10
                  2                    -                           10                        -                  20
                  3                    -                           10                        -                  30
                  4                    -                           10                        -                  40
                  5                    -                           10                        -                  50
                  6                    -                           10                        -                  60
                 6.5                   -                           10                        -                  65
                  7                    -                           10                        -                  70
                 7.5                   -                           10                        -                  75
                  8                    -                           10                        -                  80

Second Step:
The main problem to do this calibration is the temperatura because in the article only there are reported viscosities at specific 
temperatures (Segur, J. B., & Oberstar, H. E. (1951). Viscosity of glycerol and its aqueous solutions. Industrial & Engineering 
Chemistry, 43(9), 2117-2120.). To solve this problem I made different plots take this reported viscosities at different temperatures.
For this you must do different tables where x axes correspond to temperatura and y-axe correspond to viscosity for each %V/V of glycerol/
water solutions. For example this is the table for a 10 %V/V of glycerol/water solution. HHere I only placed from 0 to 40ºC (I don't
think you do the experiments at more than 40ºC) 

                    Temperatura ºC          -          Viscosity [mPa·s]
                          0                 -                2,44          
                         10                 -                1,74  
                         20                 -                1,31   
                         30                 -                1,03
                         40                 -                0,826  

Well, with this table you must to generate a third order polynomial plot (3rd order its ok due the r^2 is near to 1). So this plot result 
in this 3rd order polynomial function:

y = -0,00002*(x^3)+0,0018*(x^2)-0,0859*(x)+2,4398

where y axis correspond to a viscosity and x-axis correspond to a temperatura in Celsius grades.
