Falling ball viscosimeter calibration method

The main idea to calibrate this viscosimeter is use a solutions with a reference viscosity and measure the falling time of a 5mm steel ball for each solutions. 
This solutions should have a Newtonian behavior in rehological terms. Here we use a glycerol/water solutions that it has reference viscosity reported. 
The articule that you can use is "Segur, J. B., & Oberstar, H. E. (1951). Viscosity of glycerol and its aqueous solutions. 
Industrial & Engineering Chemistry, 43(9), 2117-2120.". This is the link to download:

The solutions that I used were 0,10,20,30,40,50,60,65,70,75 and 80% in volume/volume of Glycerol/water. 

Cautions: 

-	You must do these solutions very well since the error of the viscometer depends on this.
-	The temperature of this solutions is very important to know the reference viscosity. 
          Is for this reason that you must measure the temperature for each point that you measure.

Method:

***** First Step: 

The materials that you need are pure glycerol, 10-15ml centrifuge tubes, distilled water and 10ml graduated pipette. 
The glycerol is very difficult to work because it has high viscosity. Use the centrifuge tubes to make the different glycerol/water 
solutions. Remember that the glycerol/water solutions are in volume/volume. percentage. You must do the 10,20,30,40,50,60,65,70,75 and 
80 %V/V glycerol/water solutions with a 10ml of final volume for each solution. For example for 10 %V/V glycerol/water you must add 1ml 
of glycerol and fill with water until 10ml. Here are a help table to make this  solutions. Remember that this solutions must be well homogeneus. 
You can use a shaker to homogenize solutions.

          Glycerol volume [ml]         -          Final Volume (fill with water) [ml]        -          % V/V glycerol/water 
                  0                    -                           10                        -                  0
                  1                    -                           10                        -                  10
                  2                    -                           10                        -                  20
                  3                    -                           10                        -                  30
                  4                    -                           10                        -                  40
                  5                    -                           10                        -                  50
                  6                    -                           10                        -                  60
                 6.5                   -                           10                        -                  65
                  7                    -                           10                        -                  70
                 7.5                   -                           10                        -                  75
                  8                    -                           10                        -                  80

For solutions major of 50% V/V the glass bubbles are very difficult to remove. If you have a vacuum systema in your laboratory will be perfect 
to remove these bubbles. If you don’t have the vacuum system, I advise you after making the solutions let them rest at least until all the bubbles are gone.

***** Second Step:

The main problem to do this calibration is the temperature because in the article only there are reported viscosities at specific temperatures 
(Segur, J. B., & Oberstar, H. E. (1951). Viscosity of glycerol and its aqueous solutions. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry, 43(9), 2117-2120.). 
To solve this problem, I made different plots take this reported viscosities at different temperatures.For this you must do different tables 
where x axes correspond to temperature and y-axe correspond to viscosity for each %V/V of glycerol/water solutions. For example this is the 
table for a 10 %V/V of glycerol/water solution. Here I only placed from 0 to 40ºC (I don'tthink you do the experiments at more than 40ºC) 

                    Temperatura ºC          -          Viscosity [mPa·s]
                         0                  -                2,44          
                         10                 -                1,74  
                         20                 -                1,31   
                         30                 -                1,03
                         40                 -                0,826  

Well, with this table you must generate a third order polynomial plot (3rd order its ok due the r^2 is near to 1). So this plot result in this 3rd order polynomial function:

y = -0,00002*(x^3)+0,0018*(x^2)-0,0859*(x)+2,4398

where y axis corresponds to a viscosity and x-axis correspond to a temperature in Celsius grades.


***** Third Step:

Ensemble the electronic parts and plastic parts follow the diagrams that it is in this repository. Also, you must upload the code in the Arduino. 
Cover one side of the tube with a centimeter of hot silicone.


***** Fourth step: 

Here in this step you should measure the falling ball times with the prototype. I recommend you that you do at least 5 times for 
each solution (In this case you have at least n=5 and more statistics). The experiment is very easy and fast. Before to start the 
calibration experiment, add distilled water in a 50-100ml Glass beaker and put the thermometer inside. It is very important due 
with this water the temperature of the solutions is equilibrated before each measurement and ensure that the measurements are carried 
out at room temperature. Wait until that the thermometer stops and report this temperature. Now, Add the first solution to a 
glass tube (can be the 10 %V/V) with help of a plastic pipette until 4-5 millimeters from the top. After that, place the glass tube 
with the solution to be measured inside the glass with water to equilibrate the temperature. 
Be very careful with water, since it should not enter the glass. If this were the case, discard this solution and replace the content with 
the  10% V/V stock solution. After stabilizing the temperature solution (about 1 minute), put the glass tube into the falling ball viscometer. 
prototype. After this step, try to have everything well connected and the prototype powered. Open the serial monitor in Arduino software. 
Then with help of tweezers, take the steel ball and very carefully place it just above the tube and release it. in the serial monitor it 
should have given you the total time and the speed of descent of the ball. Then remove the glass tube with the ball and remove the ball 
tilting the tube.Try not to spill as much liquid from the solution. Fill the glass tube with the stock solution until 4-5 mm from the 
top and place it into the glass beaker with water to balance the temperature solution (1 minute). Now measure again using the prototype. 
You must follow this same procedure for all solutions. Try to report the temperature reading of the thermometer and report the times 
of fall of the ball.

***** Fifth Step:

Now you have all falling ball times reported with a correspond temperature. You should have 55 measure point (5 for each solution from 
0 to 80 %V/V glycerol/water. Then when the polynomials functions obtained in second step you can estimate the viscosity for each solution 
that you used with the temperature that you reported for each measure point. Now, you must plot the viscosity as a function of falling ball 
times (viscosity [mPa·s] is a y-axis and falling ball time [s] is the x-axis). The graph should give you a linear behavior with a r^2 similar 
to 1 (This never happened don’t worry, but the r^2 should be 0,97 or 0,98. If you got a r^2 0,99 or more congratulations). 
So, with this linear equation you can estimate any viscosity of any fluid that is in the range. 

Notes:
-	This method provide to estimate a viscosity but for fluid with less viscosity (less than 20 mPa·s) the error is bigger. 
          If this is the case I recommended you make a calibration curve with different solutions of ethylenglycol/water due the viscosity 
          range is between 1mPa·s   (pure water at 20ºC) to 20 mPa·s (at 20ºC) for 100% Ethylenglycol/water. 
-	If you unknown fluid has a high viscosity I recommended you calibrate this viscometer with high percentages of glycerol/water solutions 
          (bigger than 60 %V/V) until 100 %V/V glycerol/water.  

This is all. If you have any questions, contact me at pablo.silva.r01@mail.pucv.cl. Soon I will have more open hardware devices to make more cheap 
the investigations. I will be very interested in collaborating with anything.
