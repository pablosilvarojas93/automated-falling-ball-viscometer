Falling ball viscosimeter calibration method

The main idea to calibrate this viscosimeter is use a solutions with a reference viscosity and measure the falling time of a 5mm steel ball 
for each solutions. This solutions should have a Newtonian behavior in rehological terms. Here we use a glycerol/water solutions that it has 
reference viscosity reported. The articule that you can use is "Segur, J. B., & Oberstar, H. E. (1951). Viscosity of glycerol and its aqueous 
solutions. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry, 43(9), 2117-2120.". This is the link to download:

The solutions that I used were 0,10,20,30,40,50,60,65,70,75 and 80% in volume/volume of Glycerol/water. 
Cautions: - You must do these solutions very well since the error of the viscometer depends on this.
          - The temperature of this solutions are very important to know the reference viscosity. Is for this reason that
             you must measure the temperature for each point that you measure.
